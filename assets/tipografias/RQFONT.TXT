My hope is that the distribution of this font will encourage the development
and exchange of other such RQ products - if you have a Mac, IBM or otherwise
portable computer based RQ product, or interesting RQ material in computer 
readable format, I'd be interested in seeing it as well.


For the most part, use of the font is fairly straightforward. 
Runes have been assigned to keys on the basis of alphabetical
order or their resemblance to an an ASCII character to a rune 
(y for Truth, t for Death, * for Fate, etc.). For the most part, 
the lower or upper case versions of the character are identical - 
the uppercase (shifted) versions were included, where possible 
for the sake of convenience. In five cases, the shifted version
version is different - these are generally variations of the unshifted rune:

e - Earth    		Shift e - Dark Earth
f - Fire     		Shift f - Ice
k - Cold     		Shift k - Heat
n - Dragonewt		Shift n - Dragon
o - Light    		Shift o - Shadow


In addition, four runes can only be accessed by a shifted combination -
these are:

Shift 1 "!" - Luck
Shift 3 "#" - Trade
Shift 6 "^" - Pamalt
Shift 8 "*" - Fate

Please note that if you are using a non-Postscript printer, the 
Truetype version of the font will generally give better results.
